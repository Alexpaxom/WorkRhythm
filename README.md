# WorkRhythm


A simple but useful application that allows you to be effective, creating a to-do list will not allow you to forget about important goals. And estimating time will help you better understand the current state of affairs and better plan your time.


You can create a task in two clicks, you can add a detailed description so as not to miss anything. Move the task between the "in qeque" and "in work" tabs while you work on it. When finished, move it to the "finished" tab or delete it.
